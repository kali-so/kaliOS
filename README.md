# KaliHQ

This is a Svelte project, powered by [create-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte). The main feature of this project is a countdown timer to a specific date (Feb 1, 2024 19:00:00 GMT+0100). The countdown timer displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. When the countdown reaches zero, a message "Countdown ended" is displayed. The project also includes custom styles for the page, including a background image and color, and custom font and text color.

## Getting Started

First, install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also start the server and open the app in a new browser tab:
```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

You can preview the production build with:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
